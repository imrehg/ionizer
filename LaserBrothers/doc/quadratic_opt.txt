*Qudratic minimum search*
Adjust the position of two actuators (waveplate angles) to get maximum laser power.
The shape the the surface where the maximum is located is simple.  There will be 8 maxima
that are all equivalent and it doesn't matter which one is found.  However,
there are two subtleties:
1.  The actuators are inaccurate, with large uncontrolled differences (up to 20%) between forwards and backwards motion.
2.  The optimum slowly drifts due to thermal changes.  When we first turn on the system the drift will be faster
    (moving significantly every few minutes), and later slower (changing over an hour perhaps).


We'll dynamically establish statistics that take into account the measurement history.

Initialize:

dir=0;
i=0;

1.  Move actuator (waveplate# i) in direction dir (small step size)

2.  Record signal

3.  Fit quadratic polynomial  

4.  Establish confidence intervals

5.  If the maximum is "close" to the current position with high confidence.
    a. Stop movement
    b. Go directly to maximum.  
    c. Goto 8.

6.  If the maximum is "behind" the current position with high confidence (but not "close").
    a. Stop movement 
    b. Clear history data
    c. Reverse direction: dir *= -1;
    d. Goto 8.

7.  Goto 2.  (Either the maximum is ahead of the current position with high confidence, or confidence is too low)

8.  i++; (switch actuator)

9.  if(i > 1) wait some time interval, i=0, Goto 1.

10. else Goto 2.
