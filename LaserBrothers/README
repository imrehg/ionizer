** Purpose: LaserBrothers is software to automatically re-lock lasers and resonant cavities,
e.g. lock lasers to Fabry-Perot reference cavities or resonant doubling cavities to lasers.
The software performs only minimal feedback.  It's main function is to control the integrator 
of a separate feedback controller, and re-acquire lock when the signal is disrupted.
A GUI shows the laser status, real-time signals, and allows adjustment of parameters.

** Several additional features are implemented:
 -Automated adjustment of laser-temperature via RS232 commands to keep it within the center of it's tuning range.
  [Currently supported laser: NP Photonics fiber lasers]

 -Automated adjustment of waveplate angles to optimize the polarization of light coming out of
  optical fibers and maximize the cavity signal.  The optimization currently relies on GSL's implementation
  of the Nelder-Mead method.  Other optimization strategies are being explored.
  [Currently supported hardware: Newport Agilis rotation stages]

** Basic function
The actual feedback system consists of four main components:

1. A PDH or HC-type detector that produces an error signal
2. An analog PID-type loop filter
3. A high-voltage amplifier 
4. A PZT to control the cavity length or laser frequency.
5. A monitoring detector that checks whether the laser and cavity are resonant (monitors power build-up in the cavity).

The software uses signals from the monitor (5) to detect whether or not the system is "locked."

HW requirements (per locker):
2 A/D inputs
1 D/A output
1 Digital output

USB-DUX-D (Linux) and NI USB-6008 (Windows) analog/digital IO devices have been tested to work.
The USB-6008 devices time-out occasionally and the software must be restarted.
The USB-DUX-D devices typically run without errors.
  

For NIST-type loop filters and HV amps:

Connect the CAVITY MONITOR signal to an ADC channel.
Connect the LOOP FILTER MONITOR to another ADC channel.
Connect the HV amp SWEEP input to a DAC channel.
Connect the loop filter WINDOW input to a digital output channel.

For auto re-lock mode:

If the CAVITY MONITOR is between the min and max range from the GUI, the status switches to LOCKED.
Then the digital output (WINDOW in) goes low to enable the loop filter integrator.
The SWEEP signal gets adjusted slowly to drive LOOP FILTER MONITOR towards zero.
If "Set temperature" is enabled in the GUI, and an NP Photonics fiber laser is connected,
its temperature gets adjusted slowly to drive SWEEP towards zero.

If the CAVITY MONITOR is not between the min and max range from the GUI, the status switches to ACQUIRE.
Then the digital (WINDOW in) goes high to disable the loop filter integrator.
The SWEEP signal gets swept slowly in a search pattern.  When the CAVITY MONITOR is within the window range,
the status switches to locked, and the loop-filter integrator is enabled.

The software currently (4/2010) keeps eight lasers / cavities locked for NIST's Al+ clock, 
and several resonant frequency-doublers for NIST quantum computing experiments.

** Requirements:
See the README file in the base directory to get the build environment setup.

** Run simulated locks:
From the LaserBrothers directory (in Linux)
./install
LaserBrothers etc/laserbrothers_sim.conf
Press "RUN"

Re-write the configuration file for each laboratory setting.  
There are several sample configuration files from different labs in the etc folder.
