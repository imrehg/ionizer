Control TTL outputs of FPGA.  
Colored fields can be modified (typed in) to label the channels.  

There are three states for each channel:

0 (Red)   - Forced low
1 (Green) - Forced high
2 (Grey)  - Controlled by the FPGA's pulse sequencer

The DEFAULT command sets all channels to state 2.
When the FPGA is initialized, all channels are in state 2.
