*** DDS ***

Manually set DDS output frequencies/phases.
These will be the default settings when the program starts up.
Frequencies are rounded to the nearest value that the DDS can produce.

TEST writes and read many random frequencies/phases to each DDS,
and checks for errors.  Error messages are written to the debug port.
Be sure to disconnect any sensitive RF devices that may be damaged
by random drive frequencies before running TEST.
